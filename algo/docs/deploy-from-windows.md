# Windows client prerequisites

Before run Algo, you have to have:

* Windows 10 (Anniversary update or later version)
* 64-bit installation (can't run on 32-bit systems)

Once you verify your system is 64-bit and up to date, you have to do a few manual steps to enable the 'Windows Subsystem for Linux':

1. Open 'Settings'
2. Click 'Update & Security', then click the 'For developers' option on the left.
3. Toggle the 'Developer mode' option, and accept any warnings Windows pops up.

Wait a minute for Windows to install a few things in the background (it will eventually let you know a restart may be required for changes to take effectâ€”ignore that for now). Next, to install the actual Linux Subsystem, you have to jump over to 'Control Panel', and do the following:

1. Click on 'Programs'
2. Click on 'Turn Windows features on or off'
3. Scroll down and check 'Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta)', and then click OK.

The subsystem will be installed, then Windows will require a reboot. Reboot, then open up the start menu and enter 'bash' (to open up 'Bash' installation in a new command prompt). Fill out all the questions (it will have you create a separate user account for the Linux subsystem), and once that's all done (it takes a few minutes to install), you will finally have Ubuntu running on your Windows laptop, somewhat integrated with Windows.

Install additional packages:

```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install \
    git \
    build-essential \
    libssl-dev \
    libffi-dev \
    python-dev \
    python-pip \
    python-setuptools \
    python-virtualenv -y
```

Clone the Algo repository:

```shell
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/algo && cd algo
```

Now, you can go through the [README](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo#deploy-the-algo-server) (start from the 4th step) and deploy your Algo server!
